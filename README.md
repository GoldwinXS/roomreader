# roomreader
an app to read the room and let you know how everyone is feeling

## intro
** this is a work in progress! **

Have a presentation? Want to know how it went? Then this project might be for you...

The goal of this is to point your webcam towards the audience and get a graph of everyone's emotions. This would let you focus on your presentation and review the rooms emotions later. 

This work builds on some excellent work from https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition. 

## dependencies 

I'm still working out the best package manager for my projects... until then, you'll need to manually get the following things to get this working:
- a clone of https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition
- dlib on your system
- latest keras and tensorflow
- opencv
